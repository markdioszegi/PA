# Refrigerator

## Foreword

I created this simple project for my personal assessment. The idea is from the website. This project is all about managing (creating, reading, deleting, updating) foods (edibles, drinks, etc.) in refrigerators. The structure of the application is the following:

1. API - that contains the logic
    * Consumable class
        * Edible
        * Drinkable
    * Fridge class
2. The rest lolxd
